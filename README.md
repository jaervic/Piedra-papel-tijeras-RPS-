# [Piedra, papel, tijeras (RPS)](https://jaervic.github.io/FirstWebDevProject/)

Rock, Paper, Scissors game made with HTML5, CSS, and JS.

This is my first project. I made it with references from FreeCodeCamp and Youtube.

Styles were my idea.

My next project will be giving it a dark mode. If you want to help me with it you're free to do it.
